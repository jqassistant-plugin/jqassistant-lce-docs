# jQAssistant Language Concept Extractor Architecture

The Language Concept Extractor (LCE) architecture for [jQAssistant](https://jqassistant.org) provides a generic framework for building native tools to scan the source code of arbitrary programming languages and extract relevant language concepts from it. 
It then consolidates the extracted information into an easy-to-process JSON format for a jQA plugin.

**Refer to the [Documentation](https://jqassistant-plugin.github.io/jqassistant-lce-docs/) for more details.**
